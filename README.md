# Self-Assessment Test: Do You Perceive Reality as Potentially Simulated?
Do You Perceive Reality as Potentially Simulated? Self-Assessment Test.



## Instructions
Rate your personal perceptions and experiences on a scale from 1 to 10:
- 1 = Strongly disagree / Never experience this
- 10 = Strongly agree / Frequently experience this

## Questions

1. I experience déjà vu with unusual or disturbing frequency.
2. I notice mathematical or geometric patterns repeatedly appearing in nature around me.
3. I experience significant coincidences (synchronicities) more frequently than seems statistically probable.
4. I perceive certain physical or geographical limits in my world as artificially imposed.
5. I have experienced moments when reality seemed to "glitch" or behave inconsistently.
6. I notice that some people behave in ways that seem predictable or programmed.
7. I observe certain scenarios or situations in my life repeating with minimal variations.
8. I notice inconsistencies in how people collectively remember certain historical events.
9. I sometimes feel that time does not flow in a constant or natural way.
10. I have observed instances where physical laws seemed to behave inconsistently.
11. I find it suspicious how some technologies develop conveniently to solve specific problems.
12. I sense there are artificial limits to what humans can discover about the universe.
13. I have dreams or experiences that seem more real than everyday reality.
14. I believe certain aspects of human consciousness appear designed rather than evolved.
15. I have witnessed moments when people seemed to "reset" or abruptly change behavior.
16. I find the complexity of certain natural systems to be unnecessarily elaborate, as if designed.
17. Some of my memories feel implanted or not entirely authentic.
18. I find certain fundamental scientific discoveries suspiciously convenient for human understanding.
19. I have experienced moments when I could predict exactly what was going to happen next.
20. My understanding of quantum physics leads me to question if reality is rendered or processed.
21. I perceive human emotions as sometimes artificially limited in range or depth.
22. I notice suspicious similarities between different cultures that shouldn't have had historical contact.
23. I believe the limits of space exploration seem artificially restricted.
24. I suspect certain knowledge or technologies are deliberately kept hidden from the public.
25. I think human consciousness follows patterns that seem more algorithmic than biological.
26. I notice that probability and chance sometimes seem biased toward specific outcomes.
27. I observe that human history follows narrative patterns similar to designed storylines.
28. I perceive aspects of reality as specifically optimized for human perception rather than being objectively natural.
29. I see elements in biological evolution that appear designed rather than naturally selected.
30. I have a recurring sense that there is an underlying purpose or goal in the structure of reality.

## Scoring
Add up your total points from all 30 questions.

## Interpretation
- Total score between 30-120: You generally perceive reality as natural and non-simulated.
- Total score between 121-210: You have moderate perceptions of potentially simulation-like elements in reality.
- Total score between 211-300: You strongly perceive elements in your reality that align with simulation theory.

*Note: This self-assessment measures your subjective perception only and does not provide objective evidence regarding the nature of reality. High scores indicate personal skepticism about consensus reality, not proof of simulation.*
